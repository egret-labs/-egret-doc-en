A skeleton is a collection of bones that contain at least one skeleton. A project may contain additional skeletons.

The armatureName and the tree structure below it are typical skeletons.

DragonBones Pro starts from 4.3 and supports multi-skeleton projects.

DragonBones was first built on Flash Pro. Movie clips in Flash Pro can be nested, as in DragonBones.

DragonBones animation produced by Flash Pro including multiple skeletons or sub-skeletons can be imported and re-edited perfectly by DragonBones Pro.

Below is a DB import containing a multi - skeleton Flash Pro project.

Multiple skeletons in the imported multi-skeleton project are displayed in the repository panel, and each skeleton contains a library directory that points to a folder on the hard disk.

Different skeletons can use different library directories or share the same library directory

Hover over the child skeleton to display a preview of the skeleton.

In addition, two tool buttons have been added to the toolbar, which are selected in the red box in the figure above, respectively creating the skeleton and modifying the library path.

Click the add skeleton button, and the new skeleton dialog box will pop up. When creating a skeleton, specify the library path for the skeleton.
