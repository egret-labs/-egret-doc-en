* Refresh button

Since the display list tree changes frequently in the game, the display list tree in the Inspector is not updated in real time, instead, it is updated when the mouse clicks on the object.When you do not click for a long time, the display list tree may not be automatically updated due to great differences between it and the structure in the scene. Then you can click the Refresh button and begin reloading the display list tree.
