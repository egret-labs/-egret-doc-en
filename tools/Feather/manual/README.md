## Introduction

Egret Feather is a particle editor. It fully supports visual editing operation, and all underlying complex parameters settings are all set. Even your designer collegues with no programming skills could get started quickly and create exquisite particle effects, with its WYSIWYG( What You See Is What You Get) operation mode.  This editor can automatically export configuration files for program development, making the game effects more gorgeous!

* Texture panel
* Color panel
* Action Properties panel
* Basic properties panel
* Visual operation panel
* Rendering area panel

### Texture Panel

The current renderring texture is displayed here, and you can click or drag texture into icon so as to change the texture.

### Color Panel

The color panel contains two parts: the start color and the end color. The color will have a transition change when a particle moves from the start to its end.

### Action Properties Panel

When we are setting particle's behavior mode, we can use the gravity mode to implement some effects such as flame, rain and snow etc.

### Basic Properties Panel

Basic properties of particles, such as particle generation, number of emmited particles, rotation angle, etc. When talking about the  "emission duration" parameter, the particle emitter will stop emitting after a specified time length if the parameter value is positive, and the particle emitter will non-stop emit if the value is negative.


### Visual operation panel

The visual adjustment panel integrates parts of fragmented properties. It's very convenient and efficient, since you can alter a set of properties by mouse operation in the panel.

### Rendering Area Panel

Real-time interface preview. All properties changes will be rendered in real-time on this panel. Holding down the Ctrl/command key and click, you are able to position the emission origin to specified location.

## Preset Effect

Egret Feather has two preset template effects:

These two effects are gravity mode effects.
