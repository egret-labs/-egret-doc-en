In the new project dialog box that opens, let's give the project a name,Screen size and scene size are arbitrary, so here we're going to set it to 750x1334, a standard iPhone 6 size.

As for the difference between screen size and scene size, let me explain briefly.
> - Screen size is the area of your game that is visible, the area of the screen that is visible.
- Scene size refers to the size of the area where characters and objects can move in the game.

> In general, scene size is greater than or equal to the screen size.
For example, the scene size of super Mario is larger than the screen size, and the scene size of tank battle is equal to the screen size.

After the project is created, let's add the material file. Right-click on the image directory, select the add image material option, and then select the image material file to add.
