An instance with a scrolling behavior will have a scrolling display on game screen. Here we take the left scrolling as an example, the instance will move from right to left at a specified speed on game screen. When the instance is completely removed from the left edge of the screen, the instance will enter from the right edge, and continue to move from right to left. The general application of scrolling behavior is the background image of the game, generally landscape or portrait axis stage-mode game, such as portrait-mode game Hitting Plane, and landscape-mode Super Mario.
