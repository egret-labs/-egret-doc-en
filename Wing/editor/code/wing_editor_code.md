EgretWing allows up to three editors to be opened at the same time, and displayed side by side in the editor.

If you have already opened an editor, there are several ways to open a new editor on the right side of the editor:

- Hold down the `Ctrl` key (`Cmd` key on Mac) in the File tab and click the file you want to open
- Use the shortcut key `Ctrl + \` in the currently activated editor to divide the current editor into two parts
- Right click on the Menu of the folder tab, then select **Open in the new editor**
