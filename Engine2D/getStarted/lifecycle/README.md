
In game, player users can switch the app from the front to the back end. To ensure a better user experience, you can set to turn off game logic, render logic, and background logic after userâ€™s app is switched to the back end.



Egret Engine introduced the Lifecycle Manager since version 4.1, ```egret.lifecycle```. Its code example is shown below:

```typescript
egret.lifecycle.onPause = ()=> {
    console.log("app enter the back end");
    egret.ticker.pause(); // Turn off rendering and heartbeat
}
egret.lifecycle.onResume = ()=> {
    console.log("app enter the front end");
    egret.ticker.resume(); // open rendering and heartbeat
}
```

For different game running environment, developers can operate extension to lifecycle manager, taking mobile QQ as an example, its extension is shown as below:

```typescript

// The mobile QQ registered appInBackgound variable, and declared it in TypeScript to prevent error report
declare interface Window {

    appInBackgound:boolean;
}

egret.lifecycle.addLifecycleListener( (context)=>{
    
    // Method 1: notify by means of event monitoring
    document.addEventListener("qbrowserVisibilityChange", function(e:any){
        if (e.hidden){
            context.pause();
        }
        else{
            context.resume();
        };
    });

    // Method 2: judge from each frame
    context.onUpdate = ()=> {
        if (window.appInBackgound){
            context.pause();
        }
        else{
            context.resume();
        }
    }
} )
```
