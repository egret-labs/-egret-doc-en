## Extended library description

Depending on your project requirements, you can choose from a variety of extension libraries, and here's a look at the common ones

* Res resource loading library: the res module is a full-fledged resource loading mechanism for developers. When developers write games, they don't need to care about the details of resource loading, they just need to specify the loaded resource and add the corresponding execution loading code in the corresponding logical location.

* Eui interface authoring library: eui is a UI extension library based on Egret's core display list, which encapsulates a large number of common UI components and can be designed to accommodate most interaction interface requirements.
